# mies-node-template

A minimal ClojureScript Node.js template.

## Usage

Run the following to create a project and start auto building.

```
lein new mies-node hello-world
cd hello-world
lein cljsbuild auto
```

Changes to your source files will trigger incremental compilation. To
run your code use the provided loader file in the project directory:

```
node run.js
```

To get source map support simply run the following in your project directory:

```
npm install source-map-support
```

`node run.js` will automatically load source map support for
you and you will get accurate stack traces.
